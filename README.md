This is the python code used by Minhtet Htoon for ISEF 2020. This code is strongly based on the code found at https://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/double_pendulum_animated.html and https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/ .  Most editors will require the code to be profiled instead of just run. Use either .py file for experimentation depending on your graphics preference. Download to somewhere you will remember and launch in editor
