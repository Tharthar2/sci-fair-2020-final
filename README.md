This is the python code used by Minhtet Htoon for ISEF 2020.
This code is strongly based on the code found at
https://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/double_pendulum_animated.html and
https://scipython.com/blog/the-double-pendulum/ .
This code is NOT meant for any use besides trying to recreate my project.
Most editors will require the code to be profiled instead of just run. 
Use either .py file for experimentation depending on your graphics preference.
